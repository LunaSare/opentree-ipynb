# Developing stuff for the Open Tree of Life platform

An open lab notebook for software development.

## How to use it.

First, you will need to install jupyter notebooks. Follow some
installation instructions [here](mds/install-jupnot.md)

Next, clone the opentre-ipynb Github repo into your computer with

```
git clone git@github.com:LunaSare/opentree-ipynb.git
```

All notebooks are inside the folder `ipynb`. To run them locally from jupyter notebook, you can do:

**Option 1**. Open jupyter notebooks and navigate to the folder `your-path-to-the-repo/opentree-ipynb/ipynb`, using the graphical user interface.

**Option 2**. Open a terminal and change directory to the folder of the
repo with `cd your-path-to-the-repo/opentree-ipynb/ipynb`

Type `jupyter notebook` in the terminal, and *voil√†*, this will launch a jupyter notebook environment so you can access all notebooks and test them by yourself.
